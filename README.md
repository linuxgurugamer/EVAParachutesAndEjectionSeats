This mod provides parachutes for all Kerbals on EVA, and ejection modules, 
to be able to eject all kerbals from a craft in an Abort sequence

There are two parts for the ejection, a 1 person and an 3 person module.  
Obviously, the 1 person module can eject a single Kerbal, and the 3 person
can eject up to 3 Kerbals.

To use, place the ejection module on the crew cabin desired.  If you have
more crew than the module can handle, you can place multiple modules in order
to be able to eject all the crew.

You can change which parachute is used by right-clicking on the ejection module
and selecting the desired chute.  At this time, there is no difference in performance,
it is merely a matter of display preference

Weight and cost for each ejection module is calculated based on whichever is lower of
the following:
	The size of the ejection module
	The MAX crew that the crew pod can support.

Research Supersonic flight for the 1 person Ejection Module
Research High Altitude Flight for the 3 person Ejection Module

-The ejection module activates with the abort action group (backspace or 
 mouseover the altimeter, then the red button to the left), but you can of 
 course put it into any other action group, too

-To deploy chutes, either use the Kerbal's context menu or press Jump and 
 Use (Space+F). Jump+Use has the advantage of opening chutes on all Kerbals 
 in range (good for mass ejects), but you may have to hold it down for a 
 short time or it won't work (not sure why)

 This is a revivial of the old EVA Parachutes.
 New models have been provided with new art provided by "SpannerMonkey(smce)"
 Old square chute is still included, permission granted by "Kreuzung"

 There is a MM patch file included for those who would like to add the ejection 
 module to all manned pods without the need for the ejection parts.  The file
 is called:
		addEjectionToAll.cfg.patch

To enable this, rename the file to:
		addEjectionToAll.cfg
